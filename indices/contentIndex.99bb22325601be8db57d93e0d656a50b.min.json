{"/":{"title":"Mert Bozkir's Digital Garden","content":"\nHello everybody!\n\nI'mÂ [Mert Bozkir](content/about.md)! ðŸ‘‹\n\nThis is my constantly-updating, virtual digital garden. ðŸŒ± This digital garden is a alive, natural, and still needs more time to become a full-grown. \n\nI enjoy learning in front of others and keeping a journal of my progress, but I needed to naturally record my thoughts before posting them online.ðŸŽ¨ðŸ§ \n\nSimply enjoy the trip and be sure to have fun.\n\nFeel free toÂ [get in touch on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mertbozkirr) or rather check out myÂ [Now Page](https://mertbozkir.com/now/).\n\n#### Things I'm currently spending my time with\n\nAt Turkey, I'm pursuing a degree in computer engineering. I developed my learning skills and overcame my comfort zone to study more about Data Science, and more recently MLOps. As a mindful student, I am aware of my capabilities and am always pushing myself in this industry. I'm attempting to stand out by prioritizing creation above consumption.Â \n\n#### How to navigate this site\n\nFeel free to click around and explore.

There are already some codebases for training and prediction.

The process would be in Player level or Game Level. After the transformations of data, it sends Hive Data Warehouse, and then feature engineering/computation happens and new output are whether in Hive or S3 bucket. \n\nAlso, they have Feature Store =\u003e riotsdb implemented on S3 feature store. I couldn't find a news about it, so it would be my imagination ðŸ˜‚\n\n* Predicting which lane player go by recent activities? **(another project idea!)** They uses Decision Trees. \n\nGame personalization is **hard** for video games. Because you have to embed model into the game for speed, but even with Jax it's so hard. Updating leafs and parameters within the game etc, also there's another problem with security, needs a lot of extra steps (TCP connection, UDP only)\n\n#### Technical Reasons of why ml is hard in video games:\n* Rendering is hard when doing massive math computations well playing a game at the same time\n* Adding a network kind of security stuff is takes a lot of time. (Safely and Ethically!)\n* League is an older game and there is a lot of historical inertia and going against some of these changes. \n\n\u003e How you can get into 10+ years of C++ code with 3 differents implementations and make inference? It's pretty hard... -Ian\n\n\u003e* How many ML Engineers writes C++?\n\u003e* How many ML Engineers have interest in game engines? \n\t\"not just writing C++, but how Riot writes C++ in their codebase\" -Skylar\n\n\u003e Niche subjects that tied together along with the fact that this code base is nine or ten years old it makes it really difficult to go in there and make changes. -Ian\n\nIn the data field, the codes that you write for machine learning doesn't matter, the model that you've shipped has high level of accuracy and is delivering a lot of player matter. In the software engineering reliability and those clean code stuff really matters. \n\n#### MLOps becoming more of SE trade these days, some reflections here\n- Write unit tests\n- Use observability, monitoring (evidently ai is a tool for that -Mert)\n- Code Quality matters! (Lazslo build a CQ4DS community check it out!)\n\t- A separation between essentially code analysis vs. code for production\n- Data Science codes would suck in production, because there are not just enough software engineers people working in the data space!\n\n* There are two different of data teams in the world\n\t* 1st one taking code quality seriously \n\t* 2nd one is writing codes without code quality\n\t* At least do base level of quality, say \"look, don't submit it, let's spend more time on it.\"\n* About code quality, the approach should be like below;\n\t* Severly reduce the amount of notebooks.\n\t* Notebooks are fantastic tool for analysis but when it comes to hit production, unfortunately notebooks doesn't. -\u003e Instead build a python package. \n","lastmodified":"2022-11-19T07:58:58.494422859Z","tags":null}}
