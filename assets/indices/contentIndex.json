I developed my learning skills and overcame my comfort zone to study more about Data Science, and more recently MLOps. As a mindful student, I am aware of my capabilities and am always pushing myself in this industry. I'm attempting to stand out by prioritizing creation above consumption.Â \n\n#### How to navigate this site\n\nFeel free to click around and explore. I recommend kind suggestions and critiques on anything here and open to new forms of thought and recommendations that you might have in this process.\n\n\n",
