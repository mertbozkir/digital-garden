What I want is to build a reproducible pipeline for the ATLAS 2014 Higgs Boson challenge. There are already some codebases for training and prediction. Some people allow me to use their codes.(I would need to write code for training, because their codebases from 2014 :D) Anyway, I downloaded some papers about the technical side of the project, and I already read it all of the pages.
