This page contains my side projects that I want to work on it, but doesn't have time :/

## [League MLOps Project](/notes/league):

I have 14gigs of data from all regions. It's public in [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/d4sein/league-of-legends-patch-109)
I'm trying to parse this big file into smaller region-partitioned parquet data. Then I can train a ml model to predict which team would win? I would build pipelines and make process easy. After those stuff, I would try model for another data and data-drift will trigger for model training.


## [Particle Physics MLOps Project](/notes/particle): 

What I want is to build a reproducible pipeline for the ATLAS 2014 Higgs Boson challenge. There are already some codebases for training and prediction. Some people allow me to use their codes.(I would need to write code for training, because their codebases from 2014 :D) Anyway, I downloaded some papers about the technical side of the project, and I already read it all of the pages.
