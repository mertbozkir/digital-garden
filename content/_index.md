Hello everybody!

I'mÂ [Mert Bozkir](notes/about)! ðŸ‘‹

This is my constantly-updating, virtual digital garden. ðŸŒ± This digital garden is a alive, natural, and still needs more time to become a full-grown. 

I enjoy learning in front of others and keeping a journal of my progress, but I needed to naturally record my thoughts before posting them online.ðŸŽ¨ðŸ§ 

Simply enjoy the trip and be sure to have fun.

Feel free toÂ [get in touch on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mertbozkirr) or rather check out myÂ [Now Page](https://mertbozkir.com/now/).

#### Things I'm currently spending my time with

At Turkey, I'm pursuing a degree in computer engineering. I developed my learning skills and overcame my comfort zone to study more about Data Science, and more recently MLOps. As a mindful student, I am aware of my capabilities and am always pushing myself in this industry. I'm attempting to stand out by prioritizing creation above consumption.Â
